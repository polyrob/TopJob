TopJob
======

PlayN/TriplePlay Software developer career game. Increase your skills, climb the ladder, make enough money to constantly bail your idiot brother out of jail.

Gameplay:
Starting with only a few random skills and unemployment checks, interview for jobs to try and land a postion to increase your skills and make some cheddar. Overtime, bad luck will cause your expenses to increase and the need to make more money an immediate priority.

You can only interview for one position a month, so set your sights realistically.

The longer you stay at the same job the higher the likelihood that bad thigns will happen... so try to keep it fresh.  You also will accumulate job skills faster in different disciplines so you should be mindful of that as well.
